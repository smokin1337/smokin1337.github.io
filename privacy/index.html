      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated: February 2026</p>

      <p>
        PeopleDrop respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your
        information is handled when you use the PeopleDrop app.
      </p>

      <h2>Information You Provide</h2>
      <p>
        PeopleDrop allows you to create and manage contact profiles that may include
        personal information such as your name, phone number, email address, company,
        job title, websites, and other details you choose to add.
      </p>
      <p>
        This information is entered voluntarily by you and remains on your device unless
        you choose to share it.
      </p>

      <h2>Contact Access</h2>
      <p>
        PeopleDrop may request access to your device’s contacts to enable sharing and
        saving contact information. This access is used only for app functionality and
        is never used to collect or store contacts without your action.
      </p>

      <h2>How Your Information Is Used</h2>
      <p>
        Your information is used solely to provide PeopleDrop’s core features, including:
      </p>
      <p>
        - Creating and managing contact profiles<br />
        - Sharing contact information via QR codes, share sheets, or vCards<br />
        - Saving shared contact information when you choose to do so
      </p>

      <h2>Data Storage</h2>
      <p>
        PeopleDrop does not create user accounts and does not store your personal data
        on external servers. Your information remains on your device unless you choose
        to share it with others.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        PeopleDrop does not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. Your data is
        only shared when you explicitly choose to share it using the app’s features.
      </p>

      <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
      <p>
        PeopleDrop does not track users across apps or websites and does not sell user
        data. Any analytics used are limited to improving app performance and
        functionality.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <p>
        You are always in control of what information you add, manage, and share within
        PeopleDrop. You can edit or delete your profiles at any time.
      </p>
